                                step, the Fool leaves the past
                                behind. He
                                carries
                                nothing more than his purity,
                                innocence and trust, symbolized by the white rose in his hand. The pattern on his
                                waistcoat
                                contains
                                the colors of all
                                four elements of the tarot, indicating that he is in harmony with all that surrounds
                                him.
                                His
                                intuition is functioning
                                at its peak. At this moment the Fool has the support of the universe to make this jump
                                into
                                the
                                unknown. Adventures
                                await him in the river of life. The card indicates that if you trust your intuition
                                right
                                now,
                                your
                                feeling of the
                                'rightness' of things, you cannot go wrong. Your actions may appear 'foolish' to others,
                                or
                                even
                                to
                                yourself, if you try
                                to analyze them with the rational mind. But the 'zero' place occupied by the Fool is the
                                numberless
                                number where trust
                                and innocence are the guides, not skepticism and past experience.</p>
                            <span class="mx-3 my-2 fixed-content">Osho's Teaching</span>
                            <p class="mx-3 my-2 fixed-content">A fool is one who goes on trusting; a fool is one who
                                goes on trusting against all his
                                experience. You deceive him,
                                and he trusts you; and you deceive him again, and he trusts you; and you deceive him
                                again, and he trusts you.Then
                                you will say that he is a fool, he does not learn. His trust is tremendous; his trust is
                                so pure that nobody can
                                corrupt it. Be a fool in the Taoist sense, in the Zen sense. Don't try to create a wall
                                of knowledge around
                                you.Whatsoever experience comes to you, let it happen, and then go on dropping it.Go on
                                cleaning your mind
                                continuously; go on dying to the past so you remain in the present, here- now, as if
                                just born, just a
                                babe.DiamondIn the beginning it is going to be very difficult.The world will start
                                taking advantage of youâ€¦let
                                them.They are poor fellows.Even if you are cheated and deceived and robbed, let it
                                happen, because that which is
                                really yours cannot be robbed from you, that which is really yours nobody can steal from
                                you.And each time you don't
                                allow situations to corrupt you, that opportunity will become an integration inside.
                                Your soul will become more
                                crystallized.</p>
