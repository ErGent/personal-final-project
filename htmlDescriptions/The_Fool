        <p>Moment to moment, and with every step, the Fool leaves the past
            behind. He carries nothing more than his purity,
            innocence and trust, symbolized by the white rose in his hand.

            The pattern on his waistcoat contains the colors of all four elements of the
            tarot,
            indicating that he is in harmony
            with all that surrounds him.

            His intuition is functioning at its peak. At this moment the Fool has the
            support of
            the universe to make this jump into
            the unknown. Adventures await him in the river of life.

            The card indicates that if you trust your intuition right now, your feeling of
            the
            ‘rightness’ of things, you cannot go
            wrong. Your actions may appear ‘foolish’ to others, or even to yourself, if you
            try
            to analyze them with the rational
            mind.

            But the ‘zero’ place occupied by the Fool is the numberless number where trust
            and
            innocence are the guides, not
            skepticism and past experience</p>
